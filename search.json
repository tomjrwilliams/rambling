    "text": "1: Objections\n\n1.0: Supply = f(price) is true\nIf price increases, so does supply available for sale.\nBut, examples:\n\nCovid, semis\nUkraine, oil and gas (particularly liquification capacity)\n\nClearly, changing supply beyond relatively small local fluctations (effectively inventory on hand in most cases), requires time and cost heavy investment.\n\n\n1.1: Supply = f(price) is true except in special cases\nAre the above special cases?\nExamples:\n\nPharma\nRetail (distribution)\nRetail (marketing)\nLabor\n\nClearly, significant time and cash (and materials) is expended ahead of time, to support future supply capability.\nRather, special cases just expose the underlying process, that is otherwise behind the scenes when running smoothly.\n\n\n1.2: Supply = f(price) is false but useful\nCommon refrain, Lucas, doesn’t have to be true if (practically?) useful.\nArgue this isn’t the case, highlighting particular cases where the f(price) analysis leads to either straight wrong, or at best empirically empty, results / analysis.\n\n1.2.0: Supply is fixed in the short term\nAs we saw with covid, there’s a time component to new investment.\nWe could add a time index to our curve shifts.\nBut really, it’s actually a surface vs investment over time, for future supply.\nAt which point, it becomes obvious that price isn’t really playing a role at all: price determines which path we chose to take, but in the present, capacity is effectively already baked in.\n\n\nAside\nPrice is a much better predictor then of short term utilisation of the fixed capacity base.\nWhere a low price will lead eventually to the capacity declining, as the under-used capacity is rolled up.\n\n\n1.2.1: Price is only relevant to the extent it changes investment decisions\nGiven this, price is only relevant as a signal to the extent it changes those cumulative decisions.\nAs such, policy based on an arbitrary supply curve isn’t necessarily going to help.\nEg. …\nUnless, it clearly makes the investment attractive - for instance, that we know the price will be high in the future (demand will still be there).\n\n\n1.2.2: Investment goods / complimentary to capacity\nAlso makes clear that investment is the constraint, and that can be effected by eg. material shortages.\nIP shortages, skilled labour shortages (ie. complimentary goods).\nArbitrarily shifting the supply curve just because price has risen is to assume all of these away - clearly erroneously.\n\n\n1.2.3: Funding limits\nClearly, investment is often loan backed, if not from free cash flow.\nThus, increasing the cost of loans will reduce investment and hence future capacity, all else equal.\nEmploy america post on volker leading to capacity fall.\n\n\nAside\nMaking it clear supply changes are function of investment in capacity, and capacity is often load backed.\nImplies that demand for paper is a function of demand for new investment.\nAnd hence that borrowing will only be if perceived attractive investment opportunities.\n\n\n1.2.4: Taxes and ‘supply side’ changes\nClearly if they don’t change the RoI on the capacity itself, they’ll just lead to return of capital to shareholders.\nIe. if you weren’t investing before, they won’t make it suddenly competitive.\nWhat you actually need is long term demand for the new unit capacity.\nAnd or expected pricing power (sort of same thing).\n\n\n\n2: Pros\nSupply is dynamic - changes over time, with returns to scale, new investment, mothballing of old capacity.\nClearly, capacity is also the determining feature of a significant part of the rest of the system, because it’s a short term constant (fixed).\nWe should then be modelling it explicitly, so we can answer interesting questions.\n\n2.0: What shift will actually happen.\nRather than arbitrary lines on page, which clearly may or may not realise, we can predict whether supply will change.\nThe shifts are what we should be trying to predict as economists: not taking them arbitrarily as given.\n\n\n2.1: How long will it take\nMore specifically, we can specify and model and measure how long a particular capacity change will take.\nWe can therefore consider what the price impact might be in the short term, were there to be a demand (or supply) shock, based on long how new capacity takes to come online (and cost).\n\n\n2.2: Returns to scale\nWe can model which industries have returns to scale in what ways, as that’s a primary determinant of the investment decision.\nInstead of just being assumed linear (or even worse, sub-linear).\n\n\n2.3: Industrial configuration\nHow it will change over time is a function of the relevant industries capacity investment decisions over time, and how these end up inter-relating with demand."
