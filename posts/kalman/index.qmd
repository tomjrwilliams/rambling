Kalman filter intuition


Graph the distributions of each of the update steps


According to diferent assumptions.




The innovation series could be a linear function of some external variables

Eg macro variables


Something akin to the AQR instrumented regression approach

Where the betas are themselves linear functions of some external reference data - in this case, the fundamentals of the corporate


Which under a scaling (of the variance) is equivalent to a gaussian process, as the covariance is just an unscaled beta

So they fit the beta directly?
