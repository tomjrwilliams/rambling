kernel pca on tenor, rating

instrumented factors (eg. inflation delta to base rates, etc.)



where the kernel aspect is necessary vs instrumented
because we want to constrain the shape in a way that we cant 

so easily for the instrumented (?)
though arguably one transofmration still fits instrumented - we're still fitting discrete weights, so could work



option to only instrument some of the factors?
