In this post, we demonstrate how to use matrix completion to make predictions for missing values in a given yield curve history.

We then show how to use this approach to make forward looking reversion predictions for particular tenors on a given yield curve.

We conclude by reviewing the effectiveness of this approach in a mean squared error sense, before discussing how we might review in terms of an actual trading strategy.
