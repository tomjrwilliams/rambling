Alpha beta intuition.

Can also then look at recursive least squares.


Can the above fit a really simple rolling beta?



Can then look eg. at adding additional weights, for instance proportional to the rate of change of a rolling vol.

Eg. so we reset the beta / price accumulation after information shocks.

More obviously the case for price, but presumably would also work for corr / beta.
