### Generative model

generative model

assume some independent unit noise - factors

and some betas

observations

### Problem statement

Given observations

Assuming distrinbution of, but not known values of factors

What are betas

### Principal directions

What happened with betas (plot point cluster)

Scaling, rotation

What we're trying to reproduce, is the factors:

Gaussian cluster (original)

Ie. we're trying to de-scale, de rotate

So, to reproduce that transofmration, what we're looking for is a rotation matrix - orthogonal - and a diagonal scaling matrix.

Where our rotation takes us from the basis vector axes of our factor, to the rotated max spread of our observations.

Diagonal scaling matrix then re-scales.

### Covariance

covariacne under linear transformation is ...

intuition as:

projection, how much scale chnages (multuiploy)

then re-apply the rotation (so X ... Xt)

new covariance

We can rewrite that in terms of the orthogonal and diagonal as so:

Cov = (orthog diag) cov_orig (orthog diag).T

### Eigen vectors

We can rewrite this:

Cov orthog = orthog diag cov (orthog diag).T orthog

Given orthog .T orthog = I:

cov orthog = orthog diag cov diag

Given our original assumption, our starting cov is also diagonal, so:

Cov orthog = orthog diag diag diag

Cov orthog = orthog diag

That is to say, scaling our covarianc ematrix by our orthogonal weioghts, just rescales the weights, that is: they're eigenvalues

### Solution

As such, to find the weights, just eigen-decompose.

Weights

Eigen values give the scaling terms (or the origiainl variances).

Eignvalues

To get betas, we just combine the rotation and scaling matrices:

betas

Which we can check as so:

### Back and forth

Worth looking at what the weights are (not the eigenvalue adjusted loadings).

So, in beta representation, takes us from factors up to features.

But, in the other, it says the factors themselves are linear combinations of the features.

MSE minimising given the above.
