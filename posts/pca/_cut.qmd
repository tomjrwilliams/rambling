From this, we can see that we've also rescaled our data from the unit variance above, which we can confirm by plotting our 1D unconditional feature densities:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Feature Density: 1D"
xf.graphs.df_line_chart(
    xf.densities.gaussian_kde_1d_df(
        {
            i: features[:, i]
            for i in range(N_FEATURES)
        },
    ),
    x="position",
    y="density",
    color="key",
)
```


```{python}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Imports"

```
