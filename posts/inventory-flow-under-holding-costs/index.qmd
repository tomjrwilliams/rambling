This is a second naive inventory management model.

Here, rather than resetting to a given level after each period, we instead assume that our inventory is updated by samples from an in-flow distribution.

We then attempt to find optimal parameters for this in-flow distribution, given our holding cost, unit profit, and customer demand distributions.

Setup:
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Set module path"
import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.environ["MODULE"])
```
Imports:
```{python}
import src.inspect
import src.transforms
```


Then the next post is noisy sample of extra inventory, so we have to track from last period rather than just resetting to level each period

Optimal level to pick in flow, assuming noisy sample, holding costs, and profit per
