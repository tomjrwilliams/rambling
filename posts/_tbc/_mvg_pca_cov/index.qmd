intuion on how the beta 

in the weigts


maps up to the covariance matrix



both the univariate via cov / var -> beta

and the multivariate, how the beta squares out to covariance



and hence how to sample from a given multivariate gaussian, via the backed out beta matrix



also the relationship between the pca decomp of a covar

to independent gaussians


hence back up to the multi variate gaussian space
