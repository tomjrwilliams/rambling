I'm currently in the process of splitting out some of the factor modelling code that I've written as part of my [day job](https://havencove.com/) into the open-source package [xfactors](https://pypi.org/project/xfactors).

In the previous post, we walked through a first toy example of using xfactors for linear regression - which, frankly, was over-kill given the simplicity of the problem.

So, in this post, we'll take the slightly more involved example of probabilistic PCA, which should demonstrate the value of the package slightly better.

## Problem

PCA ...

## Solution

## Results

## Next steps

Now that ..., we'll [next](...) turn to real data: equity returns.
