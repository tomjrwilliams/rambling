Corporate demand even as a function of accumulated capacity (and downstram demand, and then profitability).

Price only via profitability.

#### Aside

Demand should be modelled as a probabilistic (order) arrival process of time t, where the price is one element of a state vector indexed on t.

Highlights that we only have local, historic, knowledge of demand response.

#### Aside

Which in turn makes clear a market need not clear for long periods of time.

Can have many more orders than fills, without capacity necessarily changing (or demand being able to change).
