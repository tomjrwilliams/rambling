Step by step intuition building via graphs

Of gamma as sum of (including partial) exponential distributions.


And the reverse transform sampling generation approach (formula).








Chi squared is a special case, sum of k squared normal samples.
 
Beta can be generated as ratio of x / x + y where each are independent gamma.

Hitting time of wiener is inverse gamma distributed, special case.
