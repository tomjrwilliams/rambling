What does the resulting 2D distribution look like.

Of exponential / gamma distributed rotation time.

Into euler.

Where gamma given an integer shape is a sum of that many exponential of the same rate.



Interesting that it takes a 1D variable into 2D space.



Even interesting looking at laplace or asymmetric laplace as the delta between two laplacians.

Rotating backwards in that case.
