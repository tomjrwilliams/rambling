Filter a universe under a given lookback

To those names with pos / neg momentum over a given threshold


Is that effectively a conditional correlation filter?

Ie. the filtered correlation matrix should have higher coefficients on average

Than the unfiltered matrix?



^^ Test this. Graph filtered correlation matrix average coefficient, distribution thereof

Over rolling universe

Versus the full matrix average correlation



Momentum trading is thus in some sense (assuming the above)

To assume continuity, stickiness, slow reversion

In that correlation matrix filtering


Ie. to bet on (continuing) dispersion, up further up, down further down



Is one way to then filter a momentum book, to evaluate whether the implied correlation filtering of the trend ranking

Is a 'sensible' correlation matrix?

Eg. has a 'clean' PC representation, for instance (large PC factor weight representation?)



If it's not, one could even trade mean reversion? So the trend vs reversion is run at the level of the entire book at once?

Ie. we assume that trends are generally cross asset in some sense

And so the trend component for a given name, should have dragged up other related / correlated names

If there's a real driver

If not, we assume idiosyncratic and revert?



I suppose that's where additional filtering can come in

For instance, if the correlation unexpected trending name

Has had a recent earnings release (or even a related name)? Or some news event, that's likely a reason not to try and revert (even if we still don't trend it)



So there's eg. ewma correlation matrix -> trend rank as filtering of the matrix

Could even whether it does indeed sort the correlation matrix, be used as the sensible ness criteria?



But then there's also, the equivalent delta but after removing certain dates (say earnings)

Where the correlation is presumably in the opposite direction - remove those dates, if the average correlation goes up

We assume those names are being driven particularly idiosyncratically (i guess assuming it also changes the trend rankings?)



So a separate signal is then, trend rank, vs earnings day (and equiv) excluded trend rank

Also big macro day excluded trend rank





The above might be easier with a kind of kernel pca approach - ie. assume a conditional covariance matrix (via time varying kernel function)

With the kernel function eg. via some kind of time varying linear factor model

Eg. varying path of factors, multiplied up into larger space of the individual assets, 

Cross product function application into the kernel function to get the covariance matrix?
