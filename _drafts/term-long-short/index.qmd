Range of values of current period production is a function of capacity

Side point: capacity can be generalised to even include previous marketing investment, r&d, shop distribution networks, as well as what probably immediately comes to mind in terms of factories

Capacity is a function of sum over long term investment, net of depreciation

For instance, case of semis, multi year projects, huge proportion of cash flow invested over time



That means each period, have to make a decision on how much to add to current capacity


But, not a nice instantaneous derivative like function

Capacity is in discrete units often, a kind of step function in time and cash, vs available capacity


That is in 4D space: max capacity, current capacity, versus cum time, versus cum investment


Where the location of the kinks will be parametrised by how quickly one can productively deploy capital in that industry

So 5D even, where that rate of efficient investment determines the trade off between bringing a kink in in time terms for the same capacity, and having to have spent more to get there in cash terms



So have to make that decision with a path in mind for the future price quantity surface of the good you sell

As you can't evaluate it instantaneously, because the derviative might be nearly zero at this point

Only over that whole step curve is it possible


So in current period, have to assume a given price quantity path


But also, in current period, capacity is essentially fixed

With incremental production range of possible values, given

With an efficiency function against utilistion, but it's not at all an unconstrained mc curve


That mc curve is really a marginal proportion of input factors

It's an mc curve given the instantaneous prices of those other goods

As to a large extent their prices are instantaneously fixed

With a slight allowance for bulk purchasing, though that then makes it a medium term decision


So in the short term, we can basically just move pricing

Which changes demand out flow


Medium term we can adjust production, but only within the range of values given by our previous capacity decisions - so quite a constrained decision




That's where i'd get frustrated - the mc curve is only partly defined, outside of the capacity range is just not possible at a given time

So there's two stages of decisions: price & inventory management (production within the capcity bounds)

And long term investment in capacity



Where one has to hold a price quantity surface constant to make that second

Whereas capacity etc. is predetermined when making the price and bounded production decision



So for instance, assume a huge temporary demand increase, might make a bunch of inefficient but fast investment to meet

Or might just hike prices if don't expect to last


Which of the two can only be determined by the above functions of possible investment speed

But also a full expected path of price / demand


If demand isn't expected to persist, investment in capacity won't be made - we'll just have higher prices (temporarily, but might persist because of lack of investment)
