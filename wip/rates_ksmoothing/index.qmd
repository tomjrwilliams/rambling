(Work In Progress)

In this post, we show how to combine our previous work on tenor kernels with matrix completion methods to make yield predictions for completely new tenors on the curve.

We illustrate the value of this approach by deriving a synthetic swap spread history from interpolated histories of a pair of bond and swap curves.
